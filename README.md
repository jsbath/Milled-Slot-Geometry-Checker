# Milled-Slot-Geometry-Checker

Characteristic Equations Thickness Ratio= 0 < ID/OD <1 LL: At no point can ID be less than zero (geometrically impossible) nor can it be equal to zero (no longer tubular but a rod) UL: Thickness ratio of unity would imply zero wall thickness and greater than unity would require ID to be larger than OD (geometrically impossible)

Depth Ratio=0 < d/((OD-ID))<1 LL: Depth Ratio of 0 would imply milled depth of zero and SCF = 1 UL: At unity or larger, the slot would become a thru hole and no longer be pressure containing

Width Ratio=2.1≤ w/d ≤39.5 LL: Minimum of 2.1 as this is the value calculated when Thickness Ratio = 0.05, Depth Ratio = 0.95, and OD = 4.5”

UL: Maximum of 39.5 by setting Thickness Ratio = 0.95, Depth Ratio = 0.05, and OD = 4.5”

Aspect Ratio= 0 ≤ L/w ≤Upper Limit LL: Aspect Ratio of 0 yields same geometry as a spot face UL: Determine from solution convergence Dimensional Equations
